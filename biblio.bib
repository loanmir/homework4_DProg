	abstract = {The COVID-19 Textbook: Science, Medicine, and Public Health explores every facet of SARS-COV-2, giving the reader an understanding of what is needed to control the spread of the virus, prevent and manage its pathological effects, as well as mitigate the impact of future pandemics. Each chapter is authored by leading global experts in the field and includes topics such as molecular biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunology, diagnosis, and the latest prevention and treatment approaches. Edited by renowned educator and medical researcher Dr. William A. Haseltine, physician-researcher, and chronic fatigue syndrome expert Dr. Roberto Patarca, it includes detailed references in every chapter, allowing easy access to comprehensive primary data.},

	abstract = {In a recent article, we introduced two novel mathematical expressions and a deep learning algorithm for characterizing the dynamics of the number of reported infected cases with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that such formulae can also be used for determining the time evolution of the associated number of deaths: for the epidemics in Spain, Germany, Italy and the UK, the parameters defining these formulae were computed using data up to 1 May 2020, a period of lockdown for these countries; then, the predictions of the formulae were compared with the data for the following 122 days, namely until 1 September. These comparisons, in addition to demonstrating the remarkable predictive capacity of our simple formulae, also show that for a rather long time the easing of the lockdown measures did not affect the number of deaths. The importance of these results regarding predictions of the number of Covid-19 deaths during the post-lockdown period is discussed.},
